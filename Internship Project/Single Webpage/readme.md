## Lessons Learned
→HTML Structure:<br>
The HTML structure seems well-organized with the standard document structure (DOCTYPE declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags).
<br>
→ CSS and JavaScript Libraries:<br>
The code includes links to external CSS and JavaScript libraries (Font Awesome, jQuery) hosted on content delivery networks (CDNs). This is a good practice for efficiency and performance.
<br>
→Responsive Design:<br>
The use of the viewport meta tag (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />) indicates an awareness of responsive design for various devices.
<br>
→Font Loading:<br>
The code includes the preconnect link for Google Fonts, suggesting an intention to use custom fonts. The specified font families are Cormorant Garamond, Dancing Script, and Josefin Sans.<br>
→Navigation:<br>
The navigation bar is implemented with both a horizontal and a responsive dropdown menu. It also includes a toggle button (&#9776;) for small screens.<br>
→Sections and Headings:<br>
The content is divided into sections with headings, emphasizing semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO.<br>
→Images:<br>
Images are used throughout the website, but there's a typo in one of the image URLs (icon-7.pngg). It's recommended to fix this typo to avoid potential issues.<br>
→Contact Information:<br>
Contact information is provided in the header and footer. This is essential for users to easily reach out or find information about the business.<br>
→Social Media Links:<br>
Social media icons are included with links. However, the actual links are placeholders (#), and they should be replaced with the actual URLs.<br>
→Newsletter Subscription:<br>
A newsletter subscription form is included in the footer, allowing users to subscribe to updates.<br>
→Footer Links:<br>
The footer includes links to various sections and social media profiles, contributing to a well-organized and navigable layout.<br>
→JavaScript Integration:<br>
JavaScript files (main.js and animation.js) are included at the end of the body, following best practices for script placement.<br>
