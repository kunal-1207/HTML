# **To Do List**
**Description:**<br>
This HTML and CSS code creates a visually appealing and interactive To-Do List web application. The background features a captivating image, and the overall design is enhanced by the use of the Poppins font from Google Fonts. The To-Do List is presented in a stylish box with a blurred backdrop, giving it a modern and sleek appearance.<br>

The input field allows users to type in their to-do items, and by pressing "Enter," the items are dynamically added to the list below. Each to-do item is displayed as a grid element with a distinctive background color and is accompanied by a checkbox-like icon on the right side. Users can mark items as "done" by clicking on them, changing their background color. Furthermore, a click on the checkbox icon allows users to remove items from the list.<br>

The scrollbar has been customized to maintain the overall aesthetic, and the design is responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes. This combination of functionality and visual appeal makes this To-Do List a user-friendly and engaging web application for managing tasks.<br>
