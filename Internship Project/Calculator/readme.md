# **Interactive Calculator Webpage with Stylish Design**
**Description:**
This HTML code presents an interactive calculator webpage with a stylish and user-friendly design. The page features a captivating gradient background, combining shades of #2d3436 and #f2eeee. The calculator itself is enclosed in a well-defined container with a subtle shadow and a border radius for a modern appearance. The Tangerine font from Google Fonts adds a touch of elegance to the calculator's title.

The calculator interface includes a large display for input and output, styled with a black background and white text for high contrast. Numeric buttons, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and a clear button are arranged neatly in a grid layout. Each button has a rounded design for a polished look. The calculator also supports basic arithmetic operations, and the result can be obtained by clicking the "=" button, which utilizes the JavaScript `eval()` function.

Overall, this calculator webpage not only provides essential functionality but also delivers an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design, making it an engaging and visually appealing tool for users.
